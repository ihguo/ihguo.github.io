*TODO* &#128197;


**spurs** are carrier or clock frequency spectral imperfections measured in the frequency domain just like phase noise. However, unlike phase noise they are *discrete* frequency components.

- Spurs are deterministic.

- Spur power is independent of bandwidth.

- Spurs contribute bounded peak jitter in the time domain.
