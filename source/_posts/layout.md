Place well tie and substrate tie where they are needed. Redundant guard ring consume area and increase the routing of critical signal net.

### Stacked MOSFETs


## Matching

1. Common Centroid

   The common centroid technique describes that if there are n blocks which are to be matched then the blocks are arranged symmetrically around the common centre at equal distances from the centre. This technique offers best matching for devices as it helps in avoiding cross-chip gradients

2. Inter-digitation

   Interdigitation reduces the device mismatch as it suffers equally from process variations in X dimension. This technique was used to layout current mirrors and resistors in PTAT and BGR circuits. In the Figure-15 below each brown stick represents a PFET of uniform length. This representation is termed as an inter-digitated layout.

### Layout Consideration

#### PODE & CPODE

> The PODE devices is extracted as parasitic devices in post-layout netlist

**DDB** is the **PODE** (Poly on OD/Diffusion Edge) in TSMC 16FFC process.

**SDB** is the **CPODE** (Connected PODE) in TSMC 16FFC process.

> PO on OD edge (PODE) is a must and to define GATE that abuts OD vertical edge
>
> CPODE is used to connect two PODE cells together. It will isolate OD to save 1 poly pitch, via STI; Additional mask (12N) is required for manufacture

#### SAC & SAGC

##### self-aligned diffusion contacts (SACs)

As shown in Fig. 35 in older planar technology nodes, gate pitch is so relaxed such that S/D contacts and gate contacts can easily be placed next to each other without causing any shorting risk (see Fig. 35(a)).

**As the gate pitch scales, thereâ€™s no room to put gate contacts next to S/D contacts, and gatecontacts have been pushed away from the active region and are only placed on the STI region.**

![image-20230708221916716](layout/image-20230708221916716.png)

In addition, at tight gate pitch, even forming *S/D contact* without shorting to *gate metal* becomes very challenging.

The idea of **self-aligned contacts (SAC)** has been introduced to mitigate the issue of S/D contact to gate shorts.

As shown in Fig. 35(b), *the gate metal is fully encapsulated by a dielectric spacer and gate cap*, which protects the gate from shorting to the S/D contact.

![image-20230708230238362](layout/image-20230708230238362.png)



>  A dielectric cap is added on top of the gate so that if the contact overlaps the gate, no short occurs.
>
>  **MD** layer represent SACs in PDK

![image-20230709005334372](layout/image-20230709005334372.png)



##### self-aligned gate contacts (SAGCs)

**Self-aligned gate contacts (SAGCs)** have also been implemented and Denser standard cells can be achieved by eliminating the need to land contacts on the gate outside the active area.

SAGCs require the source/drain contacts to be capped with an insulator that is different from both contact and gate cap dielectrics to protect the source/drain contacts against a misaligned gate contact etch.

![image-20230708232429240](layout/image-20230708232429240.png)

> According to the DRC of T foundary, poly extension > 0 um and space between MP and OD > 0 um., which demonstrate self-aligned gate contact is **not** introduced.





##### Contacted-Poly-Pitch (CPP)

> Wider Contacted-Poly-Pitch allows wider MD and VD size, which help reduce MEOL IRdrop
