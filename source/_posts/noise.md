## Cyclostationary Noise Analysis

> which is referred to as a "periodic noise" or PNoise analysis



### White Noise

> completely **uncorrelated** versus time
>
> 
> For white noise the PSD is a constant and the autocorrelation function is an impulse centered at $0$, $R_n(t,\tau)=R(t)\delta(\tau)$
>
> 
> The energy-storage elements cause the noise spectrum to be shaped and the noise to be time-correlated.
>
> This is a general property. It the noise has shape in the frequency domain then the noise is correlated in time, and vice versa.



### PNOISE

- In LPTV analysis, noise may *up-convert* or *down-convert* by $N\cdot f_c$ (**noise folding**)

- PNOISE output is **cyclostationary noise**

  Described by a collection of PSDs at various sidebands: 0 PSDs at various sidebands: $0, \pm f_c, \pm2f_c, \pm3f_c$, â€¦

>$f_c$: fundamental frequency of PSS



#### Simulation of switched-capacitor noise

> Periodic steady-state analysis is originally intended to analyze a continuous-time circuit with periodic input signals or excitations.

To simulate a switched-capacitor circuit appropriately, one needs to recognize that the output of a switched capacitor circuit is a **discrete-time rather than a continuous-time signal**. This discrete-time signal should be treated as the output of the circuit sampled after it has settled to the final value for each sampling period.

There are two techniques that one can use to force the simulator to evaluate the output signal correctly in the manner described

-in more recent versions of SpectreRF, PNOISE analysis provides a specialized time-domain analysis method

  By enabling this option, the simulator would analyze noise only **at particular time instants**

- on older versions of spectreRF, **an explicit (ideal) sample-and-hold** block can be used similarly to force the simulator to evaluate only the output of the circuit at the **correct time instants**.

  > Recall that a sample-and-hold would impose a *zero-order hold* on a discrete-time signal; thus, the resulting *sinc-shaped* response in the frequency domain has to be *compensated for*

##  Sampled Thermal Noise

The **aliasing of the noise**, or **noise folding**, plays an important role in switched-capacitor as it does in all switched-capacitor filters

Assume for the moment that the switch is *always closed* (that there is no hold phase), the single-sided noise density would be

![image-20240428180635082](noise/image-20240428180635082.png)

$v_s[n]$ is the sampled version of $v_{RC}(t)$, i.e. $v_s[n]= v_{RC}(nT_C)$
$$
S_s(e^{j\omega}) = \frac{1}{T_C} \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}S_{RC}(j(\frac{\omega}{T_C}-\frac{2\pi k}{T_C})) \cdot d\omega
$$
where $\omega \in [-\pi, \pi]$,  furthermore $\frac{d\omega}{T_C}= d\Omega$
$$
S_s(j\Omega) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}S_{RC}(j(\Omega-k\Omega_s)) \cdot d\Omega
$$

The noise in $S_{RC}$ is a *stationary process* and so is *uncorrelated* over $f$ allowing the $N$ rectangles to be combined by simply summing their noise powers

## spectrum analyzer

We tried to plot a *power spectral density* together with something that we want to interpret as a *power spectrum*

> - *spectrum* of a periodic signal
> - *spectral density* of a broadband signal such as noise
>
> Sine-wave components are located in individual FFT bins, but broadband signals like noise have their power spread over all FFT bins!
>
> The **noise floor** depends on the *length of the FFT*

[[http://individual.utoronto.ca/schreier/lectures/2015/1.pdf](http://individual.utoronto.ca/schreier/lectures/2015/1.pdf)]

signal tone power
$$
P_{\text{sig}} = 2 \frac{X_{w,sig}^2}{S_1^2}
$$

noise power
$$
P_n = \frac{X_{w,n}^2}{S_2}
$$

Then, displayed **SNR** is obtained
$$\begin{align}
\mathrm{SNR} &= 10\log10\left(\frac{X_{w,sig}^2}{X_{w,n}^2}\right) \\
&= 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{P_{\text{sig}}}{P_n}\right) + 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{S_1^2}{2S_2}\right) \\
&= \mathrm{SNR}'-10\log_{10}\left(\frac{2S_2}{S_1^2}\right) \\
&= \mathrm{SNR}'-10\log_{10}(2\cdot\mathrm{NBW}) \\
\end{align}$$

> *DFT's output* $\mathrm{SNR}$

```matlab
for N=[2^6 2^8 2^10 2^12]
  wd = rectwin(N);
  nbw = enbw(wd)/N;
  snr_shift = 10*log10(nbw * 2);
  disp(snr_shift);
end
```

output:

```
-15.0515

-21.0721

-27.0927

-33.1133
```

> The solution to the scaling problem in the case of a PSD obtained from a sine-wave scaled FFT is similarly simple. All we need do is provide the value of **NBW**

- For a filter with infinitely steep roll-off, the noise bandwidth (**NBW**) is equal to the filter's bandwidth,
- while for a filter with a single-pole roll-off, **NBW** is 2 times the 3-dB bandwidth
