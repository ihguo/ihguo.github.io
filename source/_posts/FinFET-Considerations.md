## Layout Consideration

### PODE & CPODE

> The PODE devices is extracted as parasitic devices in post-layout netlist

**DDB** is the **PODE** (poly on diffusion edge) in TSMC 16FFC process.

**SDB** is the **CPODE** (Common PODE) in TSMC 16FFC process.

> PO on OD edge (PODE) is a must and to define GATE that abuts OD vertical edge
>
> CPODE is used to connect two PODE cells together. It will isolate OD to save 1 poly pitch, via STI; Additional mask (12N) is required for manufacture

### SAC & SAGC

#### self-aligned diffusion contacts (SACs)

As shown in Fig. 35 in older planar technology nodes, gate pitch is so relaxed such that S/D contacts and gate contacts can easily be placed next to each other without causing any shorting risk (see Fig. 35(a)). 

**As the gate pitch scales, thereâ€™s no room to put gate contacts next to S/D contacts, and gatecontacts have been pushed away from the active region and are only placed on the STI region.**

![image-20230708221916716](FinFET-Considerations/image-20230708221916716.png)

In addition, at tight gate pitch, even forming *S/D contact* without shorting to *gate metal* becomes very challenging. 

The idea of **self-aligned contacts (SAC)** has been introduced to mitigate the issue of S/D contact to gate shorts. 

As shown in Fig. 35(b), *the gate metal is fully encapsulated by a dielectric spacer and gate cap*, which protects the gate from shorting to the S/D contact.

>  A dielectric cap is added on top of the gate so that if the contact overlaps the gate, no short occurs.
>
> **MD** layer represent SACs in PDK

#### self-aligned gate contacts (SAGCs)

**Self-aligned gate contacts (SAGCs)** have also been implemented and Denser standard cells can be achieved by eliminating the need to land contacts on the gate outside the active area.

SAGCs require the source/drain contacts to be capped with an insulator that is different from both contact and gate cap dielectrics to protect the source/drain contacts against a misaligned gate contact etch.

> According to the DRC of T foundary, poly extension > 0 um and space between MP and OD > 0 um., which demonstrate self-aligned gate contact is **not** introduced.





##### Contacted-Poly-Pitch (CPP)

> Wider Contacted-Poly-Pitch allows wider MD and VD size, which help reduce MEOL IRdrop
