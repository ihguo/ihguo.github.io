## Substrate noise

A variety of techniques can be used to minimize this noise, for example by keeping analog devices surrounded by guard rings, or using a separate supply for the substrate/well taps. 

However *guard rings alone cannot prevent noise coupling deep in the substrate, only surface currents*.

> PMOS are less noisy than NMOS since PMOS has its nwell which isolates the substrate noise, but such is not valid for NMOS .



## DNW

The N-channel devices built directly into the P-type substrate are not as effectively isolated as P-channel devices in their N-wells. This is because despite creating a P+ guard ring around the devices, there remains an electrical path below the guard ring for charge to flow. 

To overcome this issue, a *deep N-well* can be used to more effectively isolate these N-channel devices.

- the P-well is separated, allowing the voltage to be controlled
- because the circuit within the deep N-well is separated from the p-substrate in this structure,
  there is the benefit that this circuitry is less susceptible to noise that propagates through the p-substrate.
